## General Assembly Capstone Project

Ever since moving to Melbourne from New York, I have been keenly aware of the lack of good Mexican food in Melbourne. Overtime, this encouraged me to try and find the best Mexican food by webscraping Zomato.com for every review of Mexican restaurants I could find.

In the end, I was able to scrape about 6,700 reviews. Unfortunately, I found that almost 3,500 reviews did not have numerical review scores. Instead, as a result of Zomato purchasing Urbanspoon.com in 2015, these review ratings consisted of a sentiment, positive or negative. Zomato encourages former Urbanspoon users to update their sentiment reviews to reflect a numerical score, but this doesn't appear to be happening. 

While Zomato certainly utilises the data from the sentiment reviews already, the sentiment is not factored into a restaurant's rating. Given that over half of the reviews didn't have scores, this is substantial. Fortunately, there is an alternative: use machine learning techniques on the entries with numerical scores to predict review scores for the sentiment reviews.

I began by using a bubble plot to examine the difference between a restaurant's score on Zomato, and the average of all review scores for a given restaurant. 
- Each 'bubble' is a restaurant, and the size of the bubbles is determined by how many reviews each restaurant has. 
- The scores on the first plot corresponds to Zomato's score for the restaurant, and determines bubble size by counting all reviews (numerical and sentimental) for each restaurant. 
- The scores on the second plot corresponds to the average of review scores for each restaurant, and determines bubble size by **only** counting the numerical reviews each restaurant had.
- The color of each bubble is consistent across plots and restaurants, and shows shifts in bubbles.

Interestingly, the first plot (Zomato score) has a trend where higher ratings are generally associated with more expensive restaurants. Additionally, the colors show that some restaurants have a dramatically different score.  

## Feature Engineering and Sentiment Analysis

For this prediction of review score on the sentiment reviews to be reliable, I needed to build a good model using the 2,500 reviews that had numerical scores. The first thing I did was use spacey to analyze the review text I had. This created word type features, which kept track of proportions of each word type (noun, verb, adverb) for each review. I then used vader to analyze the sentiment of each review, which created positive, neutral, objective and compound features. 

I took things a step further by using the sentiment reviews to train a model that classifies if a review is positive or negative. This turned out to be very successful, misclassifying only 35 of 696 reviews (5.0%). Given the high accuracy I decided to use the model to impute sentiment on the 2,500 numerical score reviews as a feature.
