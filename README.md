## General Assembly Capstone Project

Ever since moving to Melbourne from New York, I have been keenly aware of the lack of good Mexican food in Melbourne. Overtime, this sentiment encouraged me to try and find the best Mexican food by webscraping Zomato.com for every review of Mexican restaurants I could find.

I was able to scrape about 6,700 reviews. However, I found that 3,500 of the reviews did not actually have numerical reviews scores. Instead, as a result of Zomato purchasing Urbanspoon.com in 2015, these review ratings consisted of a sentiment, positive or negative. Zomato encourages former Urbanspoon users to update their reviews to reflect a numerical score, but this doesn't appear to be happening.

Regardless, I still had 2,500 reviews which had numerical scores.

Given that I still had 2,500 reviews which had text, I decided to try and make use of the Urbanspoon reviews, of which there are thousands do not contribute.
