## General Assembly Capstone Project

Ever since moving to Melbourne from America, I have been keenly aware of the lack of good Mexican food in Melbourne. As a result, I decided to webscrape Zomato.com for every review of Melbourne Mexican restaurants I could find, and tried to find the best Mexican food.

Upon scraping the reviews, I found that 3,500 of the reviews did not actually have numerical reviews scores. Instead, as a result of Zomato purchasing Urbanspoon.com in 2015, these reviews rated a restaurant as positive or negative. Zomato was encouraging former Urbanspoon users to update their reviews to reflect a numerical score. Unfortunately, this doesn't appear to be happening.

While I still had 2,500 reviews which had text, I decided to try and make use of the Urbanspoon reviews since there are thousands of these sentiment reviews which do not contribute.
